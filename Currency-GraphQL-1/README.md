## Currency GraphQL Project...kinda

This small project was my first bit of exposure to GraphQL with React. I am working my way to using React Native, GraphQL, and Mongo together in a project and this was a positive step in the right direction. The most important part has been using the Apollo Provider, Apollo Client, chaining queries to the client and eventually making queries as a component.

Moving forward, I have a lot of questions regarding query components and best practices for keeping modular.
